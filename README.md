# __Project Overview and its Features:__

* __Comprehensive System Development:__ I have developed a Medical Camp Management System named Mediserve Mobilize using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). The goal is to enhance user-friendliness and functionalities for Organizers, Healthcare Professionals, and Participants, ensuring an ideal and efficient platform for the management of the Mediserve Mobilize web app.
* __User Authentication and Role-Based Access Control:__  Implement a secure user authentication system using Firebase. Assign roles, including Organizer, Healthcare Professional, and Participant, during the registration process. Control access based on these roles, directing users to personalized dashboards post-login, and include secure logout functionality.
